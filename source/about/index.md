> Social Dist0rtion Protocol is a collective intelligence spawned in the waste
> products of social media virtual realities and psychedelic drugs. SDP emerged
> in 2045 to fight the transplanetary corporations that commodify democracy,
> manipulate governments, and destroy the environment. SDP gained visibility 10
> years later by coordinating the hacking operation “Hunt Zuckerberg”, which
> aimed to capture Mr. Zuckerberg and turn him over to the Decentralized Courts
> of Cyberjustice. The operation was successful, but it wasn’t enough to heal
> society’s deep wounds. SDP’s new strategy is to travel back in time to warn
> earthlings about the dystopian future they face if they don’t fight.
